{"ALG_DESC": "Works with:\nProcessing R Provider: version 2.x and newer \nQGIS: version 3.4 and newer\nR: version 3.5.3 and newer\n\nThis algorithm makes it possible to implement a typological analysis based on quantitative data aggregated in spatial units. It first allows to perform a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on N variables and then to apply a HAC (Hierarchical Ascending Classification) on the first factors. This algorithm is mainly based on the FactoMineR package developed by Fran\u00e7ois Husson et al (Agrocampus Ouest, Rennes, France). \nThe output tables and plots are exported respectively to Excel and to png format and then are inserted into an html file that automatically pops up in a web browser at the end of the process. The eigenvalue table and the variable coordinate table on the axes are also added to the table of content in QGIS. Finally, the algorithm creates a new layer which contains an attribute field indicating the cluster each spatial unit belongs to, so as to make it easy to map the typology. For this purpose, a style file in QML format is created and can be used as default rendering (the colors of the clusters are the same as those on the 3D hierarchical tree). \nThe algorithm offers several setting options with default values.\n\nREFERENCES---------------\n\nBENZECRI, J.P., (1973) L'Analyse des donn\u00e9es, Dunod, 619 p.
